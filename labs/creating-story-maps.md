# Outcomes and Objectives
- investigate story maps and activities
- create a draft story map for the project
- leverage GitHub project boards

# What are Story Maps? 
(freely available resource: [User Story Mapping by Jeff Patton](https://search.library.uvic.ca/permalink/01VIC_INST/1ohem39/cdi_askewsholts_vlebooks_9781491904862))

> Stories get their name from how they should be used, not what should be written.
>
> Story maps are for breaking down big stories as you tell them.

Backlogs are rarely *flat*, ranked lists of things to do. They are interconnected, dependent, multi-dimensional.

Story maps create 'narratives', scenarios of how the system should be used.

----
# The problem
Imagine working on a system this size. Each yellow sticky represents maybe a day of work.

----
# Backbone
From the top, story maps have **activities**, big 'chapter' narratives; then **tasks**, sub-sections of the chapter; and below that *backbone*, the different steps -*stories*- for that chapter.

----
We can assign users to each 'chapter' or activity. The x-axis reflects the story flow (e.g., login to order completion email).

# Release Planning
Horizontal slicing divides stories into release slices. The idea is that everything in the first slice is in the first release, and the product as a whole has a coherent narrative (the x-axis).

----
# Release Planning
In our project, we have 2 "releases": Assignment 4 and 5. We are artificially separating them into backend (data store) and front-end (interface).

In practice, releases are much more involved. 

----
# Concepts (from Patton's book)
- Tasks are short verb phrases that describe what people do.
- Tasks have different goal levels.
- Tasks in a map are arranged in a left-to-right narrative flow.
- The depth of a map contains variations and alternative tasks.
- Tasks are organized by activities across the top of the map.
- Activities form the backbone of the map.
- You can slice the map to identify the tasks youâ€™ll need to reach a specific outcome.

----
# Walking Skeleton
The skeleton idea is we target the first release to have a bare-bones idea of what we need in the product. We then increment from there in subsequent releases.

"see it work" - Must Have
"make it better" - Should Have
"make it releasable" - Could Have
"not enough time" - Won't Have

# MVPs
> The minimum viable solution is the smallest solution release that successfully achieves its desired outcomes. (Jeff Patton)

and
> A minimal viable product is also the smallest thing you could create or do to prove or disprove an assumption. (Eric Ries)

You should be aiming for an MVP by Assignment 5. 
The task in Assignment 2 is to figure out what "desired outcomes" are. 

----
# Creating USMs

- Install the VS Code extension `TextUSM` or visit https://textusm.com 
- Write the activities and tasks quickly - use some stickies or notepad
- THen link the user stories in to your map.
- Export the result to a PNG.

----
# Sample
see [example here](labs/usm-sample.usm)
make sure to use the `.usm` extension

----
# Syntax
see https://app.textusm.com/help
each indent creates a new sub-level
