# Introduction
About me. 

Reminder of course policies on collegiality and collaboration:
- answer messages within 24 hours (or sooner).
- respect each person's ideas and contributions. Not everyone likes to talk loudly.
- pull your weight to the best of your abilities.
- get work done on time as requested by your team.
- everyone is busy. If you are struggling, let your team or us know.

# Project timeline and modules
reminder of the project timeline and dates:
(see [Brightspace for deadines](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/lms/dropbox/admin/folders_manage.d2l?ou=265981) and [Github for the project repo](https://github.com/uvic-seng321/course/tree/main/project))

----
# Groups
- size of max 5, min 4
- ideally in the same section
- register for a project group on Brightspace
- we then create the groups on GitHub as well for you to create a repo
- communication must happen on Teams and on Github (you can use Discussions if you so choose)
- instructors are members of the Github and Teams projects/channels

----
Take some time to organize yourselves into groups. Don't worry if you don't have a group yet. We can help you form groups.
This should take about 20 minutes.
As you establish your groups, please register your group on Brightspace via the Groups menu.

----
# Group Formation Phase
When you have a group, decide on
- a group name
- meeting times (some time in lab will be available most weeks)
- individual strengths and a preliminary tasking
- Assignments 4 and 5 will have more programming. Assignment 3 is focused on PM work and crowdsourcing.
- read the [assignment 2](../project/assignment2.md) specification.
- you may wish to begin thinking about the programming language you will use for the project. It should have a testing framework and a web framework. 

----
# Project Ideas Phase
- spend the remainder of the lab exploring and researching ideas. You want two.
- a good project is 
  - fun to work on for your team (you all like the idea)
  - something you have some knowledge of (bus schedules)
  - big enough to generate at least 10 user stories of high priority
  - tractable enough for your team to implement a web app with a front end and back end by April.
  - have some online social media sources (Reddit, Twitter, etc) with hundreds of discussions. 
  - have at least one other place to get requirements such as a set of interview subjects (e.g. the Rocket club) or existing requirements documents
