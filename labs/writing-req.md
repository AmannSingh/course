# Lab 2 - Begin Writin' Gud Requirements

----
# Practice time!
(from text). 
You are building a music sales store like Bandcamp. One of your business analysts has identified a complaint from users that they want to be able to preview a song before they buy it. 

Write a requirement for this feature. Take a few minutes with your team. Remember: this is a functional requirement, and your statement should describe what the system should do (problem), not how it should do it (solution).

----
Here is how the book has it:
> As a Customer, I want to listen to previews of the available songs so I can decide which ones to buy.’  

What are the problems with this statement?

----
# Problems with the statement
- not clear what "preview" means
- what is the "available songs" list? who decides on that?
- how long is a preview?
<!-- -add more as they generate them -->

# Criteria for good requirements (p 203)
- **Complete**: the requirement should be self-sufficient and not require additional information to be understood.
- **Correct**: this is an actual customer problem.
- **Feasible**: the requirement is something that can be implemented within the constraints of the project.

----
- **Necessary**: the requirement is important to the business need for the system.
- **Prioritized**: the requirement is ordered in terms of importance to the business need for the system.
- **Unambiguous**: the requirement is not open to interpretation.
- **Verifiable**: it is clear how tests can be written to establish the requirement can be objectively verified as being met.

# More To Come! 
This is a set of basic criteria to get you started. But they are also criteria we will use to assess the requirements you create for Assignment 2.

Remember these maxims from the book:
> - Anyone who reads the requirement comes to the same interpretation as any other reader.
> - Each reader’s interpretation matches what the author intended to communicate.
