title: Requirements Analysis topics 
---

Analysis and modelling are the phases of the RE lifecycle where we start trying to understand what we have learned and putting it into written or diagrammatic form. Software Verification and Validation (V&V) is the process of ensuring that 

- The software being developed or changed will satisfy functional and other requirements (validation) and 
- Each step in the process of building the software yields the right products (verification) 


# Learning Outcomes
- Characterize the relevance of requirements analysis and where it sits in the lifecycle.
- Demonstrate capability in different modelling and analysis techniques like social models, use case models, data flow diagrams, and UI models. 
- Apply these models to the project. 
- Differentiate between modelling approaches and analysis outcomes in order to prioritize requirements.
- Learn about how bots are used in RE and software engineering.
- Appreciate the difference between validation and verification.
- Identify V&V activities and where in the software lifecycle the occur.
- Apply formal methods when appropriate.
