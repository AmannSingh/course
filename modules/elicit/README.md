title: Requirements Elicitation topics 
---
An early task in RE is to understand what requirements users actually have. And they rarely formulate them as requirements, so we must translate their desires into more specific requirements. 

# Learning Outcomes
- Understand the different elicitation techniques.
- Recognize different sources of requirements.
- Select between different elicitation approaches and know the advantages and disadvantages of each.
