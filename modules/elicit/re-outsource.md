# RFPs
- "requests for proposal" aka "request for comment" "solicitation of expressions of interest" etc.
- a list of business and high level requirements vendors can bid on
- typically highly constrained process: legal implications, restrictions on interactions, firm bid dates, multiple types of contracts (defining payment terms, overage possibilities, etc.)

# Outsourcing Pain Points
- clashing cultures and usual challenges with distributed teams
  - See our course on "Global SW Dev"
- negotiation and agreement on definitions
- contractual and legal challenges
