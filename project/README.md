# Overview
This is a project-based course. Students will elicit and document requirements and use test- driven development and behavior-driven development techniques. The project will be completed in groups of 3-4 students.

You should know how to use Github and be able to write basic Javascript code and tests. If you are not familiar with Github, "Assignment 0" will help. 

**All due dates will be on Brightspace. All submissions should be on Brightspace in the appropriate assignment folder.**

The details of the assignments are as follows:
- [Assignment 0 (not for marks): Learning Git and GitHub](https://classroom.github.com/a/2LyUppR2) (GitHub classroom link - make sure I know your GitHub username)
- [Assignment 1 (5%): Discovering Solutions (individual)](assignment1.md)
- [Assignment 2 (30%): Requirements documentation](assignment2.md)
- Assignment 3 (5%): Continuous Integration Setup (individual) 
- Assignment 4 (25%): TDD implementation
- Assignment 5 (25%): BDD implementation
- Assignment 6 (10%): Reflect and report (individual)
