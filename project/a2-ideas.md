# Assignment 2 - ideas

Submit your project ideas and sources for the TA to review. It is not formally marked. We will give feedback on it to help steer you in a tractable, fun direction.

The submission should be a PDF, and include two ideas. One is your preferred choice you researched the most in lab, and the other is a backup.

Describe:

1. the project name and context
2. the potential sources of requirements from the crowd (issue trackers, TikTok, Reddit, other social media)
3. the potential users you can talk to (fellow students, UVic clubs, friends and family, local companies...)
4. a very rough sketch of what you think the requirements will be and how you might implement them.
