# User Stories
1. As a collection curator, I want to set a date after which data will expire and be deleted or hidden then deleted. 
2. As a consumer, I want to know that the data I am downloading is good and can be relied on, so that that I don't have to check it myself or run into annoying bugs later on. 
3. As a participant, I want to be shown all estimates at the same time after all estimators have given their estimate, so that I can be sure estimates are independent and not influenced by other estimates given in the same draw. 
4. As a parent, I want to be able to see which consent forms Ihave submitted, so that I can know what I still need to do. 
5. As a trainer, I want to list my upcoming classes in my profile and include a link to a detailed page about each, so that prospective attendees can find my courses. 
6. As an admin, I want to handle all users' activities, so that I can manage more efficiently. 
7. As a data librarian, I want to extract pointers from the DMP to metadata held in other systems, so that I can import this metadata into a data catalogue. 
8. As an administrator, I want to create and maintain venues, so that I can provide location details to help users find what they are looking for. 
9. As an anonymous user, I want to have a dedicated page for each class to learn more about the offering. The following information must be shown: Logo, title, trainers, location, possibly a map view, datetime, skill level, registrations remaining, link to register for class. The URL path should be SEO friendly / training / training-title, so that I can choose the right class, AND the trainer can tweet and promote their class.
10. As a user, I want to be able to create an account, so that I can create my own profile.
